Deploying automation helps your team reduce toil and creates space for innovation that would otherwise be used to respond to unplanned work.

Our automation needs to fit snugly into the application lifecycle; in some cases it might be completely bespoke, while in other cases it might be something off the shelf. But it should be treated in the same way we treat the development of the application - undergoing testing and employing good practices. When we approach the operational life of our applications as part of the features of the applications, creating and maintaining automation components becomes part of the application development process itself.

There are many areas where automation can help your team. These resources can help you think about where automation makes the most impact.
